## Proposal 1: File Explorer
Visualize your file system, Jarvis style so that you can read documents and search through files on your computer. Potentially have the ability to annotate documents (highlighting / underlining). The user should be able to open up multiple documents at the same time and then place them in different areas in 3D space.

## Proposal 2: Jeopardy VR Sim
One of the biggest challenges in preparing for Jeopardy is the reaction speed required to press the buzzer after the answer lights come on. I want to build something which simulates the game in actuality. You would have a board where you could choose the question, the question would appear on the tile that you select, and then the question is read aloud. When the question finishes, the lights blink and you can click the controller to answer the question. If possible I would like this to be multiplayer. Questions will be sourced from j-archive.

## Proposal 3: Wheel of Fortune Sim
Similar to the previous proposal, but slightly different because now we can spin the wheel! That is a set VR action and guessing letters can be chosen from a keyboard that pops up after the spinning completes. If possible this would also be multiplayer.
